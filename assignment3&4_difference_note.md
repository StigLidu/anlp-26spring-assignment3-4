## 3. Project Hours policy and rubric updates

- Time with TA changed from about 13.5 minutes to about 15 minutes.
- TA assignment/slot announcement deadline changed to 3/20.
- Rubric changed from a 100-point weighted breakdown to 4 completion items (1 point each): Research topic, related work, baseline reproduction plan, initial proposed approach.

## 4. Assignment 4 submission and grading updates

- Report page limit changed from 9 pages to 8 pages (main body).
- Grading table changed format from "Points" to "Percentage (%)".
- Criteria weights were adjusted: Introduction 15 -> 10; Project Scope and Completion 10 -> 20; "Limitations" + "Ethical Considerations" were merged into one line ("Limitations & Ethical Considerations": 5).
- New clarification text says grading is split into section quality/completeness plus overall project scope/completion.

## 5. Poster and FAQ updates

- FAQ merged and strengthened attendance language: New "Project Hours/Poster Session Conflicts" section states both Project Hours and Poster Session require in-person attendance and sign-in; missing scheduled Project Hours or Poster Session leads to a 0 for that component.
